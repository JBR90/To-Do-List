# To-Do-List

# Reflection

I have learnt a lot with this project but it still contains bugs and the organisation of the code is poor. I need to research the MVC structure and Single Responsibility Principle.

#Bugs/improvments
Local storage broke mark todo's as done
Can't delete sections
Not responsive
CSS design flaws
